## Smart Contract: SettlementRamp

### Contract Overview
The SettlementRamp smart contract is a decentralized solution for handling verified PayPal payments and their settlement on the blockchain. It provides a secure and automated way to manage payment attestations and settlements through ChainSettle integration.

### Contract Address and Network
```
Contract: SettlementRamp
Address: 0xdA7248aD6DB23139605Ef5F8De0C6d9C9c8313Ae
Network: Base Sepolia
Transaction Hash: 0xf8ca6f0b94312b80842ec70566b695cf9211b0edde92241fa029836b3a7fa714
Block Number: 25846447
```

### Technical Specifications

#### State Variables
```solidity
// Payment tracking
mapping(bytes32 => Payment) public payments;
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public isSettled;

// Access control
mapping(address => bool) public authorizedAttesters;

// Payment limits
uint256 public minPaymentAmount;
uint256 public maxPaymentAmount;

// Constants
uint256 public constant MAX_CHECK_COUNT = 10;
uint256 public constant CHECK_INTERVAL = 1 hours;
```

#### Key Functions

1. **Payment Attestation**
```solidity
function attestPayment(
    bytes32 escrowId,
    address payer,
    uint256 amount,
    string calldata paypalTxId
) external onlyAuthorizedAttester validAmount(amount)
```
- Records new payment attestations
- Verifies ChainSettle attestation
- Emits PaymentAttested event
- Enforces payment limits
- Requires authorized attester

2. **Payment Settlement**
```solidity
function settlePayment(bytes32 escrowId) 
    external 
    onlyAuthorizedAttester 
    nonReentrant
```
- Marks payments as settled
- Verifies ChainSettle finalization
- Emits PaymentSettled event
- Prevents reentrancy attacks

3. **Payment Verification**
```solidity
function getPaymentDetails(bytes32 escrowId) 
    external 
    view 
    returns (
        address payer,
        uint256 amount,
        bool settled,
        string memory paypalTxId,
        uint256 lastCheckTimestamp,
        uint256 checkCount
    )
```
- Returns detailed payment information
- Includes settlement status
- Provides audit trail

    external
```
