# Settlement Ramp Project Documentation

## Overview
Settlement Ramp is a blockchain-based solution that bridges off-chain payments (like PayPal) with on-chain settlements, providing a secure and automated way to verify and settle payments using smart contracts and a Python backend.

## Architecture

```mermaid

    A[User] -->|Initiates Payment| B[PayPal]
    B -->|Payment Verification| C[Backend Service]
    C -->|Register Settlement| D[ChainSettle Oracle]
    D -->|Attestation| E[Smart Contract]
    E -->|Settlement| F[Blockchain]

    end
    
    subgraph "On-Chain Components"

        E
        F
    end
```

## Components

### 1. Smart Contracts
- **SettlementRamp.sol**: Main contract handling payment verification and settlement
- **Interfaces**:
  - ISettlementRegistry: Interface for ChainSettle oracle
  - IChainSettleAttest: Interface for attestation verification

### 2. Backend Services
- **Main Application**: FastAPI-based service
- **Services**:
  - PayPalService: Handles PayPal payment verification
  - ChainSettleService: Manages ChainSettle oracle interactions
  - BlockchainService: Handles blockchain interactions

### 3. Testing
- Unit tests for smart contracts
- Integration tests for backend services
- End-to-end testing scenarios

## Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant P as PayPal
    participant B as Backend
    participant C as ChainSettle
    participant S as Smart Contract
    
    U->>P: Initiate Payment
    P->>B: Payment Notification
    B->>C: Register Settlement
    C->>B: Settlement ID
    B->>C: Initiate Attestation
    C->>S: Verify Attestation
    S->>S: Process Settlement
    S->>U: Settlement Complete
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Base Sepolia Configuration
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=
SETTLEMENT_RAMP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
SETTLEMENT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=

# ChainSettle Configuration
CHAINSETTLE_API_URL=
CHAINSETTLE_AKASH_URL=

# PayPal Configuration
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Security
PRIVATE_KEY=

# API Configuration
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
DEBUG=True
```

## Security Considerations
1. Private key management
2. API key security
3. Smart contract security
4. Oracle verification
5. Payment validation

## Deployment

### Smart Contract Deployment
1. Compile contracts
2. Deploy to Base Sepolia
3. Verify contract
4. Update environment variables

### Backend Deployment
1. Set up environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure services
4. Start application

## Testing

### Smart Contract Tests
```bash
forge test
```

### Backend Tests
```bash
pytest
```
